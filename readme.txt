SUPPORT:
    
Since KARDS is distributed for free, support is not offered. KARDS is coded according 
to current web standards and we did our best to make the template easy to use and modify.
If you have minimum web development experience, you can easily modify the template. 
However, If you're still new to HTML and CSS, I suggest that you visit the 
following tutorials:

 - http://tutsplus.com/course/30-days-to-learn-html-and-css/
 - http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/

These will teach you the essentials of HTML and CSS. In addition, if you want to include
jQuery in your skill-set, you can also check out these tutorials:

SOURCES AND CREDITS:

This project was adapted from a public template and fully customized for sergeyz.tk.

Instagram Gallery (Local Manifest Approach):

To populate the portfolio gallery with your Instagram photos:

1. Upload images to `images/instagram/` (jpg, png, gif, webp supported).
2. Run the manifest generator to create `data/instagram.json`:

   ```powershell
   python scripts/generate_manifest.py --src images/instagram --out data/instagram.json
   ```

3. Commit both the images and `data/instagram.json` to the repository.
4. The gallery will render from the manifest without requiring any API tokens.

This approach keeps the repository token-free and secure for public hosting.
