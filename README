Personal gh-pages website for Sergey Zhukov (sergeyz.tk)

This repository contains a static single-page portfolio site (Jekyll-compatible) adapted
from the KARDS HTML template and customized for sergeyz.tk.

## Quick start (local Docker)

1. Build and run the site locally with Docker Compose:

	 ```powershell
	 docker compose up --build
	 ```

2. Open http://localhost:4000 in your browser.

Notes:
- The Docker container installs and builds native Ruby gems required by the site (nokogiri, commonmarker).
- If you update gem versions in `Gemfile`, regenerate `Gemfile.lock` and commit it before rebuilding the image.

## Instagram gallery (manual, token-free)

To populate the portfolio gallery with images without storing API tokens in the repo:

1. Add image files to `images/instagram/` (jpg, png, gif, webp supported).
2. Generate a manifest with the bundled script:

	 ```powershell
	 python scripts/generate_manifest.py --src images/instagram --out data/instagram.json
	 ```

3. Commit `images/instagram/` and `data/instagram.json` to the repository — the site will render the gallery from the manifest.

## Security & maintenance

- Do not add API tokens or secrets to this public repo. If you need automated syncing, use a separate private workflow or external storage.
- The `Gemfile` was updated to prefer patched versions for vulnerable gems. To update the lockfile locally, run:

	```powershell
	# backup
	cp Gemfile.lock Gemfile.lock.bak
	# update specific gems
	bundle update rexml nokogiri activesupport
	# or regenerate (use with caution)
	rm Gemfile.lock && bundle install
	```

## Docker / local dev notes

- `docker compose up --build` will build a local image (Ruby 3.2) and install gems.
- If you run into gem compilation errors (native extensions), ensure system build libraries are available in the image or run the provided container-based update steps in the README.

## Changes in this fork

- Removed server-side Instagram syncing and GitHub Actions that required repository secrets.
- The site now prefers a local manifest `data/instagram.json` generated from `images/instagram/`.
- Header and branding cleaned up; resume updated and `Download CV` linked to `files/szhukovcv.pdf`.
